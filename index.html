    <div class="bg-dark text-white text-center mb-5">
        <p>Welcome to the history of Dennis the Menace! This page provides a brief overview of the character's origins, development, and impact on popular culture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-dark text-white text-center mb-5">
        <p>The idea and name of the character emerged when The Beano editor George Moonie heard a British music hall song with the chorus "I'm Dennis the Menace from Venice".</p>
        <p>The character first appeared in 17th March 1951 issue of The Beano</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p class="list-inline p-3 pt-5">Dennis's first comic strip appearance consisted of him walking into the park with his father and his dog, where a sign is planted informing visitors that they should 'Keep Off the Grass'. Keeping in with his "world's naughtiest boy" tagline</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p class="list-inline p-3 pt-5">In 1970, Davey Law took ill and retired from the strip, leaving Dennis in need of a new artist. Dave Sutherland, who was already the artist of Biffo the Bear and The Bash Street Kids, was chosen. Dennis made a cameo in a Biffo story in 1972, citing his wish to be on the cover.</p>
                <p class="list-inline p-3">In 1980, The Beano reached a landmark 2000th issue. The front cover depicted Dennis offering to show readers the first issue of the comic. Incidentally and fitting well with the character's menacing nature, the comic was at the bottom of the pile.</p>
                <p class="list-inline p-3">In 1996, the first Dennis animated series was released on the UK station CBBC, with a second series following in 1998.</p>

                <p class="list-inline p-3 pt-5">In 2000, Dennis became a major mascot for Beanoland at the Chessington World of Adventures theme park. He was featured prominently throughout the land including a large figure atop the shop, a member of the squirting water fountain, a character on the dodgems.</p>
                <p class="list-inline p-3">In 2009, Dennis was featured in a new animated series called "Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed!" which aired on CBBC. The show introduced a new generation of fans to the character and his adventures.</p>

                <p class="list-inline p-3 pt-5">David Parkins' workload meant he was able to draw the strip on an increasingly less frequent basis throughout his time on the strip, and after 2003 he became too busy to continue as a full-time artist. Nigel Parkinson, who had previously been drawing the strip as Parkins' understudy, continued as artist, along with Jimmy Hansen coming in to replace Parkins.</p>

                <p class="list-inline p-3 pt-5">When the strip was relaunched in 2009, Dennis faced several changes to his character and appearance. It was the first major revamp of the character since his introduction over 50 years prior. Parkinson, Hansen and Paterson continued to draw the strips, although Dennis became slightly shorter with a boyish look to him as opposed to the brute, tough guy look the previous artists had established.</p>

                <p class="list-inline p-3 pt-5">By August 2012, Dennis's 2009 revival was reverted following yet another revival of the comic. His illustrations were more in tone with David Parkins' era and he partook in genuine naughtiness and disruption again. Nigel Parkinson was named sole official Dennis artist and began the weekly strips while Barrie Appleby returned to Roger the Dodger. Like his 2009 revival, Dennis faced several new changes mainly because of a new editor. His old behind the nose grin returned and he began to once again refer to himself as a 'menace'.</p>
