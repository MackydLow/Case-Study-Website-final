        <h2>Who is He?</h2>
        <p>Dennis is an uncontrollable schoolboy who takes pride in causing 
            chaos and mayhem to those around him due to his intolerance for rules 
            and order. He is the bad boy of the school, The main recurring storyline throughout the years 
            features his campaign of terror against a gang of "softies" (effeminate, well-behaved boys),
             particularly Walter the Softy. Walter finds himself in unfavourable circumstances on many 
             occasions, although he sometimes gets the last laugh. Dennis is quite often considered the villian
            in the story. He would often prove himself to be selfish and greedy, 
            tending to disregard his friends in favour of treasures.  Dennis is often 
            considered to be a loner, seeking no solace in anyone's company aside from his 
            faithful pet dog Gnasher, however he does have a fairly stable friendship with Minnie the Minx and
             Roger the Dodger. </p>
